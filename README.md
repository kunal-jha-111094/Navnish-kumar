Dear Navnish,

My name is Kunal Kumar Jha, and I have recently completed my Masterâ€™s in VLSI from MAHE, Manipal. In my final year, I designed and implemented a pipelined processor based on the RISC-V ISA using a MIPS-style architecture, which aligns closely with my keen interest in processor design. I also have a solid understanding of pipeline hazards and thread-level parallelism.

I believe I am a strong fit for this role due to my hard work, dedication, and technical proficiency. My core skills include:

* Digital Logic Design

* C Programming (with Data Structures)

* Computer Architecture

* Verilog & SystemVerilog

I am confident that my technical background, combined with my commitment to delivering high-quality results, will allow me to contribute effectively to your team.

Looking forward to your response.

Best regards,
Kunal Kumar Jha
